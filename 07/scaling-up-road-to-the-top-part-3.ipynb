The challenge when training such models is generally GPU memory. Kaggle GPUs have 16280MiB of memory available, as at the time of writing. I like to try out my notebooks on my home PC, then upload them -- but I still need them to run OK on Kaggle (especially if it's a code competition, where this is required). My home PC has 24GiB cards, so just because it runs OK at home doesn't mean it'll run OK on Kaggle.\n \nIt's really helpful to be able to quickly try a few models and image sizes and find out what will run successfully. To make this quick, we can just grab a small subset of the data for running short epochs -- the memory use will still be the same, but it'll be much faster.\n\nOne easy way to do this is to simply pick a category with few files in it.

But there's a few significant differences...\n\nThe first is that I'm using a `finetune` argument to pick whether we are going to run the `fine_tune()` method, or the `fit_one_cycle()` method -- the latter is faster since it doesn't do an initial fine-tuning of the head. When we fine tune in this function I also have it calculate and return the TTA predictions on the test set, since later on we'll be ensembling the TTA results of a number of models. Note also that we no longer have `seed=42` in the `ImageDataLoaders` line -- that means we'll have different training and validation sets each time we call this. That's what we'll want for ensembling, since it means that each model will use slightly different data.\n\nThe more important change is that I've added an `accum` argument to implement *gradient accumulation*. As you'll see in the code below, this does two things:\n\n1. Divide the batch size by `accum`\n1. Add the `GradientAccumulation` callback, passing in `accum`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def train(arch, size, item=Resize(480, method='squish'), accum=1, finetune=True, epochs=12):\n    dls = ImageDataLoaders.from_folder(trn_path, valid_pct=0.2, item_tfms=item,\n        batch_tfms=aug_transforms(size=size, min_scale=0.75), bs=64//accum)\n    cbs = GradientAccumulation(64) if accum else []\n    learn = vision_learner(dls, arch, metrics=error_rate, cbs=cbs).to_fp16()\n    if finetune:\n        learn.fine_tune(epochs, 0.01)\n        return learn.tta(dl=dls.test_dl(tst_files))\n    else:\n        learn.unfreeze()\n        learn.fit_one_cycle(epochs, 0.01)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*Gradient accumulation* refers to a very simple trick: rather than updating the model weights after every batch based on that batch's gradients, instead keep *accumulating* (adding up) the gradients for a few batches, and them update the model weights with those accumulated gradients. In fastai, the parameter you pass to `GradientAccumulation` defines how many batches of gradients are accumulated. Since we're adding up the gradients over `accum` batches, we therefore need to divide the batch size by that same number. The resulting training loop is nearly mathematically identical to using the original batch size, but the amount of memory used is the same as using a batch size `accum` times smaller!\n\nFor instance, here's a basic example of a single epoch of a training loop without gradient accumulation:\n\n```python\nfor x,y in dl:\n    calc_loss(coeffs, x, y).backward()\n    coeffs.data.sub_(coeffs.grad * lr)\n    coeffs.grad.zero_()\n```\n\nHere's the same thing, but with gradient accumulation added (assuming a target effective batch size of 64):\n\n```python\ncount = 0            # track count of items seen since last weight update\nfor x,y in dl:\n    count += len(x)  # update count based on this minibatch size\n    calc_loss(coeffs, x, y).backward()\n    if count>64:     # count is greater than accumulation target, so do weight update\n        coeffs.data.sub_(coeffs.grad * lr)\n        coeffs.grad.zero_()\n        count=0      # reset count\n```\n\nThe full implementation in fastai is only a few lines of code -- here's the [source code](https://github.com/fastai/fastai/blob/master/fastai/callback/training.py#L26).\n\nTo see the impact of gradient accumulation, consider this small model:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train('convnext_small_in22k', 128, epochs=1, accum=1, finetune=False)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's create a function to find out how much memory it used, and also to then clear out the memory for the next run:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import gc\ndef report_gpu():\n    print(torch.cuda.list_gpu_processes())\n    gc.collect()\n    torch.cuda.empty_cache()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"report_gpu()","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So with `accum=1` the GPU used around 5GB RAM.
